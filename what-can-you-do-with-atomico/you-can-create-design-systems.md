# You can create design systems

Many teams decide to use Atomico for the development of their design systems thanks to its similarity with React, which greatly facilitates the incorporation of human talent into the development of design systems.

We thank IBM IX since they have shared their experience in the development of the design system for their client Barmer, you can follow this case through Discord or Github.
