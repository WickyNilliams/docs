# You can create design systems

Many teams decide to use Atomico for the development of their design systems thanks to its similarity with React, which greatly facilitates the incorporation of human talent into the development of design systems.

### Why use Atomico to create design systems?

1. Atomico offers you Storybook 7 Support with superpowers, thanks to [**@atomico/storybook**](../packages/atomico-storybook.md) you can create stories without the need to declare the argTypes or args since [**@Atomico/storybook**](../packages/atomico-storybook.md) creates them for you
2. [**@atomico/vite**](../packages/atomico-vite/) makes it easy for you to build in NPM-friendly ESM format
3. [**@atomico/exports**](../packages/introduction/) makes it easy for you to export your code by automatically adding the metadata so that it is optimally consumed as a package, `@atomico/exports` can even automatically create wrappers for React, Preact and Vue
4. [**@atomico/potscss-tokens**](../packages/atomico-postcss-tokens/) makes it easy for you to maintain a token system efficiently and sustainably

## Use cases
